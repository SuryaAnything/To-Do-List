# To-Do List Management System
This project contains Java code for a simple to-do list management system and user account handling. The code consists of three main classes:

## Classes

### 1. AccountInfo
- Manages user account information.
- Tracks user names, IDs, and passwords.
- Provides methods to create, clone, and verify user accounts.

### 2. DoList
- Implements a basic to-do list functionality.
- Allows adding, removing, displaying, and marking tasks as complete or incomplete.

### 3. UserChoice
- Contains the main method to handle user interactions via a console-based menu.
- Allows users to create accounts, log in, and manage their to-do lists.

## How to Use

1. **Compilation**: Compile the Java files using a Java compiler (e.g., `javac`).
   ```bash
   javac AccountInfo.java
   javac DoList.java
   javac UserChoice.java
2. **Execution**: Run the UserChoice class to start the program.
